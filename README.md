## 💡 Why CampusLoop?

Every engineering college has the same four problems:

**Problem 1 — Opportunities get buried**
Someone shares an internship link in a 200-person WhatsApp group at 11pm. By morning it's buried under 80 messages. Students miss critical deadlines.

**Problem 2 — Senior knowledge disappears**
Every batch of seniors has notes, project reports, and placement experiences. When they graduate, all of it disappears. Juniors start from scratch every year.

**Problem 3 — Nobody knows who works on what**
You want to learn React but don't know a single person in college who uses it. There's a student two classrooms away building the same stack — but you never meet.

**Problem 4 — Placement prep is scattered**
DSA on one YouTube channel, system design on another, interview experiences on LinkedIn. No single place exists for your college's specific placement context.

**CampusLoop solves all four.**

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

**Real-time notifications** — Flask-SocketIO creates a room per branch. When a post is created, the server emits to that room. All connected users in that branch receive the notification instantly without polling.

**JWT auto-refresh** — Axios interceptor catches 401 responses, silently refreshes the access token using the refresh token, then retries the original request. Users never get logged out unexpectedly.

**Optimistic UI** — Upvote count updates instantly on click before the server confirms. Reverts automatically on failure. Makes the app feel instant.

**Branch-targeted feed** — Posts are targeted to specific branches or ALL. The feed query filters using PostgreSQL's `ANY()` operator on the array column — only relevant posts reach each student.
